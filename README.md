# Parallelization-of-Optimizers-for-Single-Objective-Functions
<p><center>
Single objective optimization algorithms are the basis of the more complex optimization	algorithms such as 
multi-objective, dynamic, constrained optimization algorithms and so on. Research on single objective optimization algorithms influence the development of the optimization branches mentioned above. In the recent 
years, various kinds of novel optimization algorithms have been proposed to solve real-parameter optimization 
problems. Our project aims to parallelize such optimizers for solving single objective problems with the help 
of threading libraries. Evaluation of the performance of these optimizers on specific problems can be studied 
under different constraints as a part of a larger framework, to improve performance of the algorithms and 
better understand the suitability of the same.
